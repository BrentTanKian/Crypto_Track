# Crypto_Track
Cryptocurrency tracker that tracks 5 popular kinds of crypto, returns their prices for the last 10 days, and generates corresponding graphs. 
Pyinstaller generates an executable file, and on double clicking this file, 3 files are produced: An excel file that contains the prices, 
average, minimum, and maximum for the last 10 days up to the time of running the executable, a png file with the price trends for bitcoin
plotted on a graph, and another png file with the price trends for 4 other popular cryptocurrency types. The test_files folder contains 
samples/examples of what these files look like.
